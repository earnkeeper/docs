# White Paper

## Project Introduction
---

EarnKeeper, the leading Play and Earn analytics platform. We are on a mission to make Research easier for Play and Earn gamers.

Discover the most popular and best earners in the space, deep dive with relevant and tailored analytics for any game, powered by our open source platform.

Players should know whether they are paying to play or playing to earn, it is not always obvious, and changes constantly. We have built a platform that reacts quickly to changes, allowing us to get you the information you need to stay safe and maximise your earnings.

## The Problem to Solve
---

Play to Earn games provide a way for users to earn a living, by exchanging effort and time for reward. Each game is different, the method to earn rewards is different and their economy will evolve in different ways. A generic analysis is not enough to determine return on initial investment into Play to Earn games.

The space also comes with risk, new users to the space expecting a return generally do not understand the risk of becoming a bag holder.

Gamers should have access to resources that help them understand the economies of the games they play, presented in an easy to use, rich interface, to allow them to grow as blockchain users and have fun along the way.

We enable this for players through our powerful open source framework, with deep integrations to the block chain, off chain databases and premium content providers.

The framework is flexible enough to provide information on the economic health of hundreds of games, while still being able to deep dive into individual games to give exact information on the costs and potential earnings of the game.

## The Game Discovery Platform
---

Find the most popular, healthiest and highest earning games in the space.

### Social Activity Tracker

We monitor the twitter, discord and telegram following counts for hundreds of games, watching for changes in following, a great indicator of how well a community is engaging with each game.

The top ten games each hour are displayed on our front page, for quick access to the highest trending games in the space at the moment.

### New Users Tracker

Gamefi projects rely on a steady stream of new users to keep a healthy economy, we analyse hundreds of game contracts to find wallets that are interacting with the game for the first time. A powerful indicator of whether the game's marketing efforts are working, and the economy is in good health.

In realtime, we display the games with the largest changes in new user activity today on our front page.

### Token Volume Tracker

Active tokens indicate an active economy, checking token volume rather than token price gives you better insight. We scan the blockchain transactions across as many chains as possible to find total token volume each day, see where the users are transacting and how the user base reacts to game news.

Each day, we list the top 10 games by change in token volume on our home page, easy access to which games have lots of on chain activity today.

### Rich Game Information

For each game of our hundreds of games, we gather the important data, resources and content that gamers need to stay on top of the games they are playing, and decide whether to enter new games.

Token price, social counts and game description.
