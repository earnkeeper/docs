# Plugins

## What is a Plugin?

An EarnKeeper plugin is a bundle of code running on a remote server. 

It collects data from the block chain and directly from a game, formats that data, and sends it back to EarnKeeper to display in the browser.

## Why Plugins?

EarnKeeper started as a single web page written in React to provide data for the BSC game CryptoZoon. It was really popular and provided really useful information for players. 

It was a hobby project, so the developer couldn't really keep up with the feature requests and hold down a full time job. The community wanted to help, but there was no safe way to do that with a client side React app.

EarnKeeper as it is now was born out of this need, provide a safe client side app, a consistent user experience and allow any developer to contribute data to reduce the bottle neck on a single individual.

We tried many options, and the plugin system was the winner! Any developer can write a plugin, a game can have multiple plugins, they are all open source so we can all learn from each others work, and the user can pick and choose which plugins they want to use.

## How do You Use Them?

Developers add their plugins to our marketplace, and you as the user choose which ones you would like to use. Browse or search the marketplace, and `Install` any plugins you would like. 

Feel free to install lots of plugins and try them out! If they are not useful for you, you can remove the ones you don't want. By installing plugins you are simply adding more features and data to each game that you play.
