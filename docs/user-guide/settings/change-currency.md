# Change Currency

Each game uses its own utility tokens for NFT values, rewards and more. To understand a players investment, it is often easier to convert these values to a fiat currency at the current price.

Earn Keeper supports conversion of token values into 11 currencies as of time of writing, and will support more as needed.

By default conversions will be made to USD. 

To change your display currency, use the currency drop down at the top of each page.
