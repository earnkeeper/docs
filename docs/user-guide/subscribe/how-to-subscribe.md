# How to Subscribe

### Accounts Page

Browse to the accounts page from the main menu or directly: https://earnkeeper.io/account

![Account Page](/img/subscribe/account-page.png)

### Connect Your Wallet

In order to subscribe, you will need to connect your wallet to our site. We need this to confirm you are you, and to track your payments. 

We only read your public address, we will never request you to send a transaction using your wallet.

Connect your Metamask wallet by clicking the Connect button at the right of the page.

Metamask will prompt for you to sign a message for https://earnkeeper.io. This step proves ownership of your address, it does not actually perform any transaction.

Go ahead and press Sign.

### Swap to USDC token

To provide a stable payment experience, EarnKeeper uses USDC as its payment token.

If you don't have any USDC in your wallet, you can convert some of your tokens directly to USDC from your Metamask wallet.

We accept subscription payments on the Polygon and Binance chains, Ethereum is too expensive at the moment! 

So make sure you have one of these chains selected in your MetaMask.

Open your metamask and click the Swap function.

2. Select USDC as token to receive.
3. Choose the amount you want swap. You will see a USD conversion.
4. Preview the Swap and in the next screen confirm the Swap.

### Refresh Your Page

The only thing left is to refresh your account page on EarnKeeper.io to confirm the Premium subscription has been correctly activated.

Check the buttons. They should correctly give you the expiration date of your subscription and the ability to extend your subscription.
