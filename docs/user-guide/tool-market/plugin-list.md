# Plugin List

The Tool Market is the central hub of the Earn Keeper ecosystem. 

Developers can add their plugins to the market, and users can search the market and install the plugins that are useful for them.

Want to learn more about plugins and why they exist? 

[Check out our page on them here](../plugins.md).

Each plugin in the market has an image, a title and short description. Like below ðŸ‘‡.

![Plugin Tile](/img/user-guide/plugin-tile.svg)

The image and the title will generally indicate which game the plugin supports, and the short description will describe what the tool is adding to the game.

The bottom of each tile shows (in order) how many times the plugin has been installed by Earn Keeper users and the average user rating of the plugin (more on ratings later)

To get more info on this plugin, click on its image to open a Plugin Details popup.
