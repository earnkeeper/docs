# Filtering

To the left of the plugin list, is a list of filters to reduce the number of plugins shown. If you are on mobile, click the small hamburger menu above and to the left of the plugin list to see the filters.

You can filter the list by the following fields:

### Installed

By default all plugins are shown, use this filter to show only plugins you have installed (Yes) or plugins that you have not yet installed (No).

### Games

Each plugin is associated with a game, and there could be mutliple plugins associated with the same game. By default all games are shown, uncheck any games you would like to hide. 

Alternatively, click the `Clear all` link to show no games, then check the games you would like to view.

### Installs

We count how many times each plugin has been installed by our users, use this slider to only show plugins with installs in a particular range. When you click (or tap) and hold on the slider it will show you the range being covered.

### Stars

Users can rate each plugin, to tell the community which are the stand out plugins. The minimum rating is one star and the maximum is five stars. Use the slider to only show plugins with a certain number of stars.

### Reset Filters Button

If you want to reset all of the above filters to the default, click the Reset Filters button at the bottom of the page to start again.
